# Basic Implementation of Chess Rules in Python

Objective of this `chess.py` is to implement simple but precise and reliable chess rules engine without unnecessary 
notations, just to work with __Machine Learning (ML)__ models. As briefly mentioned, `chess.py` file is the only source
file used here and using only two (2) classes from that file, would be able to successfully test the chess rules. 

Besides, the `chess.py` only one class has been used here just to throw custom exception in validations. That class 
is `utils.commons.PromotionInvalidException` which is a custom Python `Exception` class and would not be discussed here.
